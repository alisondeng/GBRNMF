# GBR-NMF
This repository contains R code for running group and basis restricted non-negative matrix factorization. 

The code is still in early stage development overall, and a manuscript detailing the method is in the final stages of preparation --- expect an arXiv link to appear here once ready. The code has minimal comments and is not yet structured as a traditional R package. AKA, user beware!
